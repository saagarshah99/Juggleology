# Juggling

<img src="/static/images/Juggling-Web-App-Screenshot.png" />

For my undergraduate final year project, I built a social network and portal for jugglers, using Django, Bootstrap and jQuery, that integrates many tools for managing oneâ€™s juggling experience. Users can organise juggling tricks and set goals, visually learn tricks using a graphical simulation, communicate with others and host events.
